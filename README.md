# AVRConfig
    <div id="text">

    <p>AVRConfig is simple multiplatform graphical interface for the program avrdude written in JavaFX. It was developed to make working with AVR microcontrollers easier (primarily for people who don't like console). It was also developed for those who did their projects with Arduino or with other simple SW and HW and want to try programming in pure C with only classical HW. The application uses the program avrdude by Brian S. Dean.</p>
